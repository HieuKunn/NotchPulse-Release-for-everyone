## Overview

**NotchPulse** transforms your MacBook camera cutout and external displays into a dynamic, responsive, and powerful workspace center. Engineered natively with Swift and SwiftUI, it integrates on-device biometric Face ID recognition, live synced lyrics, interactive media widgets, drag-and-drop file shelf, and battery status right in your menu bar.

## Core Features

### 1. Seamless Face ID & Unified Morphing
- **Native Hardware Morphing**: Face ID expands directly out of the physical MacBook Notch or floating Dynamic Island, dynamically adapting corner radii and silhouettes without separate floating windows.
- **Lock Screen to Desktop Continuity**: Authenticates instantly upon screen wake and carries smoothly from the lock screen directly into your active desktop workspace.
- **macOS System Prompt Interception**: Automatically intercepts administrative privilege prompts and Touch ID requests, enabling hands-free face verification throughout macOS.
- **Privacy-Preserving On-Device AI**: Powered by on-device neural embeddings and Apple Vision framework with secure Keychain credential injection.

### 2. Dynamic Island & Notch Dual Architecture
- **Adaptive Display Modes**: Switch effortlessly between the native MacBook Notch profile and an iPhone-inspired floating Dynamic Island pill.
- **Multi-Monitor Awareness**: Automatically detects hardware cutouts on built-in Retina screens while rendering centered, symmetrical designs on external monitors.
- **Fluid Spring Physics**: Every transition is driven by custom interactive springs tuned for Apple ProMotion 120Hz displays (`response: 0.38`, `dampingFraction: 0.8`).

### 3. Lock Screen Media & Synced Lyrics
- **Live Synced Lyrics**: Real-time synchronized lyric stream with active line tracking, smooth autoscroll, and expanded full-screen reading mode.
- **Adaptive Lock Screen Widget**: Dedicated glassmorphic player accessible during playback from Spotify, Apple Music, and web browsers.
- **Smart Queue Retention**: The media card remains accessible while paused and automatically tucks away when audio sessions conclude.

### 4. Media Hub & Audio Visualizer
- Integrated transport controls, track scrubbing, volume adjustments, and responsive audio visualizers directly inside the notch.
- Intelligent graphics throttling pauses all GPU animation passes when playback is paused or hidden.

### 5. Notch Shelf & Quick Share
- Drag and drop files, images, and text onto the notch to temporarily stash them.
- Quick AirDrop forwarding, clipboard copying, and shelf pinning for multitasking.

### 6. Multi-Display Hardware HUD
- Fine-grained brightness and audio control across both built-in Apple Silicon panels and third-party external monitors via DDC.

### 7. Power Status & Battery HUD
- Real-time battery percentage tracking, charging connection notifications, and quick power status popover in the notch.

### 8. Resource-Efficient Engineering
- **Zero-Idle Overhead**: On-demand CoreML model loading saves memory at launch; background timers and sensors are strictly gated by visibility and active state.
- **Lightweight Footprint**: Native AppKit and SwiftUI implementation with no web-engine or Electron overhead.
